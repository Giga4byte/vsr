## Overview

Visual Speech Recognition is a cutting-edge approach that recognizes speech by analyzing lip movements from video input. This system can be used in various fields, including accessibility for the hearing impaired, security systems, and more.

## Key Features

- **Lip Reading**: Recognizes spoken words from lip movements.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Uses a deep learning model to process video frames in real time.
- **Accuracy**: The model has been trained on large datasets for high accuracy in speech recognition.
